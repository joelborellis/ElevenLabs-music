Create a 30-second high-energy electronic pop composition designed as a short-form ad or brand stinger. Start with an immediate, attention-grabbing hook using a pure electronic/EDM palette: punchy drums, bright synths, and a clean bass line in E major, set at 122 BPM in a straight 4/4 groove for maximum catchiness. Keep the mood euphoric and uplifting, with simple diatonic pop harmonies and a melodic synth lead (no sung lyrics or vocals), ensuring the midrange remains uncluttered for compatibility with voiceover. Build rapidly, maintain radio-polished production, and resolve with a satisfying “button” stinger ending. The structure should be: instant intro (hook) → quick build → energetic climax → button finish, leaving room for clear brand messaging overlay.
