# Epic Space Battle – Cinematic Action Loop

```text
Instrumental only. Create a 90-second cinematic electronic-orchestral action score for the climactic battle of a space opera: starships clash in a high-stakes conflict among the stars. Begin with a bold, heroic introduction (D minor, 120 BPM, straight 4/4), establishing the tension with hybrid orchestration—strings, brass, huge percussion, powerful synth pulses. Structure as EDM drop-inspired: dramatic intro leads to an intense build, then explosive drop (the battle’s peak), followed by a tension-filled breakdown and final driving section. Let epic motifs evoke the vastness and peril of interstellar combat, using escalating harmonic lifts and swelling textures. The loopable core should sustain action energy, and a clean outro wraps with a cinematic flourish. Maintain a polished, modern mix with sweeping atmosphere and dynamic contrasts—let the music vividly capture the choreography of clashing starships and the heroism of a decisive cosmic showdown.

# Cozy Lo-Fi Instrumental Podcast Bed

```text
Create a 60-second, loopable instrumental in a warm lo-fi/chillhop style to serve as a cozy and unobtrusive podcast voiceover bed. Use a laid-back swing or shuffle feel with a gentle tempo around 92 BPM and choose a soft, inviting key such as F major or D minor. Feature minimal acoustic drums, warm electric piano, subtle bass, and mellow textures—no vocals, melodies, or dense midrange leads, ensuring the music stays soft and supportive for spoken voice. The energy should flow steadily with subtle evolution, jazz-tinged harmonies, and a relaxed, intimate atmosphere throughout. Aim for a polished, balanced studio mix with clear separation between elements and no harshness.

# Bright Electro Pop Ad Hook (Brand-Ready)

```text
Create a 30-second, high-energy electronic pop track designed as an ad spot, following an Ad Hook Format: start with an immediate, catchy hook, build quickly with punchy drums, bright synths, and a clean bass line in E major at 120 BPM, and finish with a crisp, memorable stinger ending. Keep the structure concise and uplifting, with an energetic, euphoric mood. Instrumentation should feature a polished EDM-pop sound with a melodic synth lead (no vocals or sung lyrics), leaving midrange clear and uncluttered for potential voiceover use. Ensure the arrangement is radio-polished and balanced, with space and dynamics that support a brand-safe call-to-action or spoken message layered on top.
